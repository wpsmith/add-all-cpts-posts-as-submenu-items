Automatically add all of a custom post type's posts as submenu items.

== Description ==

When adding a page, category, or any hierarchical custom post type or taxonomy to your navigation menu (Appearance &rarr; Menus), this plugin allows you to optionally automatically add all of a custom post type's posts as submenu items.

In short, you'll no longer have to manually maintain submenus when you add a new child page to your site.

Built off of Viper007Bond's Add Descendants As Submenu Items.
